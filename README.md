# 🥊 UFC-HAT: Data Analysis and Evaluation of UFC Fighters

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and evaluates UFC fighters using historical fight data from ESPN and official UFC records.  
The goal is to rank fighters using an ELO-based system that considers **who a fighter defeated and when they defeated them**.

For example, defeating a rookie superstar should not be rewarded the same as defeating that same fighter during their prime.

This project is exploratory and designed to generate interesting insights from combat sports data.
